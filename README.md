* ***Introduction***
* In November 2021, a psychological intervention was designed based on one of Robert Cialdini’s principles of social influence (Cialdini, 2014). The purpose of the intervention was to test the possibility of socially influencing a population. The primary principle of social influence implemented was that of social proof, with some additional incorporation of the principle of consistency. While the intervention had its strengths, such as internal validity and robust sampling, the intervention model is worth examining critically through a secondary lens of attitude principles. Vogel and Wänke (2006) report additional perspectives on attitude change, delving deeper into methods and reasons why persuasion works and does not work. These perspectives on attitude change, as well as recommendations for alternative practices in future interventions, are discussed in detail.
* ***Attitudes & Persuasion***
* Throughout life, many individuals will seek to influence the attitudes of others. Changing attitudes may provide a means of changing the behaviour of others, as reaffirmed in a recent meta-analysis (Glasman & Albarracín, 2006). Petty and Briñol (2010) report that when it comes to attitude change, a key part of successful influence is understanding the "basic mechanisms” which drive persuasion. Among dual-processing models of persuasion, heuristic versus systematic processing is of special to interest to advertising media influence (Chaiken, 1980). According to Chaiken, highly engaged individuals are more likely to be persuaded by arguments whereas passively engaged individuals are more likely to be persuaded by the likeability of a source; additionally, Petty and colleagues (1981) found that a sense of personal investment in a message increased its persuasiveness. It follows, then, that the effectiveness of beauty advertising messaging is bolstered both by its interpersonal appeal (a beautiful woman presenting an idea) and its sense of consumer involvement (eye contact with camera and second person script phrasing). The strength of an attitude will also have significant effects on how difficult it is to change (Crano & Prislin, 2011); is it a fleeting feeling or thought, which could have been influenced by prior questions on a test, or is it a firm evaluation based in formative experiences? The former could be exemplified in the effects of a brief exposure to different messaging, the latter created by years of exposure to ideologically uniform messaging.
* ***The Present Study***
* Some persuasion efforts are elaborate in nature. Consider the intervention called “’People Seem to Like This a Lot’: an Instagram Social Proof Intervention Proposal” (hitherto referred to as “the Instagram intervention”). In the Instagram intervention, a robust sample of women college students aged 18-28 were to be invited to a laboratory setting where they would take a pre-test on body image and similar measures, be exposed to an Instagram feed with body-positive imagery for 10 minutes, then take a post-test like the pre-test. The theory of social proof was incorporated where “likes” on body-positive content were predicted to increase participants’ openness to body-positive messaging. 
* ***Study Strengths & Flaws***
* The Instagram intervention boasts several strengths, such as the theoretical backing of social proof and the realistic nature of the content; however, it also has several flaws. Attitude change is more likely to influence behaviour when the attitude is easy to recall and stable over time (Glasman & Albarracín, 2006). Considering this information, a temporary adjustment of a poor body-image attitude is not likely to create lasting change in the way a person behaves. Many years of conditioning from matriarchs and peers have likely taught college-age women to feel self-conscious about their appearances, and a multi-billion-euro beauty industry thrives on messaging which maintains those attitudes in women (Haworth‐Hoeppner, 2000; Michael et al., 2014; Humphrey, 1989, Kilbourne, 2000). Additionally, even individuals who identify as skeptical of beauty advertisements may still feel the influential effects of body messaging over time as the “sleeper effect” sets in (Hovland, Lumsdaine, & Sheffield, 1949).
* ***Recommendations***
* In future interventions, it would be advantageous for researchers to take a more direct route of persuasion. The Instagram intervention implemented indirect heuristic persuasion, but ten minutes of exposure to passively influential content cannot stand against 18-28 years of beauty messaging. As researched by Chaiken (1980), highly engaged individuals are more likely to be persuaded by arguments. Rather than having participants scroll through images, it is recommended to present them with rhetoric and perhaps practice motivational interviewing which challenges their bodily paradigms. While asking *“Why is it you think being a size large makes YOU fat but not your friend?”* is unlikely to completely reverse two decades of programming, it has more of a chance of making the participant pause and reconsider than does a ten-minute Instagram session.
